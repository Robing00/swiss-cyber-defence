# 1 - RESOURCES

## Knowledge needed for action

1. Knows typical structural elements of phase-oriented ICT projects (e.g.,  project phases, subprojects, work packages, tasks, work steps) and of  agile ICT projects (e.g., backlogs, iterations / sprints, timeboxing).

2. Knows typical items of resource planning in ICT projects (e.g. personnel,  
   material, operating resources, external services)

3. Knows suitable methods for determining or estimating effort (e.g.,  
   analogy method, expert panel, 3-point estimation, PERT method).

4. Knows relevant factors influencing the planning of personnel expenses  
   (e.g. availability, qualification, idle time and downtime).

## 1.1 Project Structure

  - People: Development, Testing, Analysis
  
  - Equipment: Technical, Admin, Logistics
  
  - Material

## 1.3 Estimation

- Cost Planning
  
  - TCO
  
  - Benefits

  - Need for estimates / Basic principles
  
  - Analogy method, Percentage method, Delphi method, Three-time method ("beta method"), Poker Planning (agile)

## 1.4 Planning Personnel Expenses

- Ressource Planning
  
  - Roles: Ressources, People, Material resources
  
  - Objectives: little shortage, little excess
  
  - Approach
    
    - 1, 2, x iteration of plaing (raw, detail planning)
    
    - Kiss - keep it simple, stupid
  
  - Variance: Productivity variants

# 2 - EFFORTS AND COST PLAN

## Knowledge needed for action

Determines effort based on resource planning and prepares a  structured cost plan.  

1. Knows the difference between investment costs, project execution costs and operating costs.  

2. Knows different cost rates in ICT projects and can name standard industry and market rates.  

3. Knows simple costing models for calculating expenses.  

4. Knows the approach to cost management in agile ICT projects (fixed cost framework, fixed deadlines and open scope) and the importance of a clearly agreed collaboration code (values, principles and practices).

## 2.1 Difference between investment costs

- Cost Categories: Investment costs, Execution costs, Operating costs

- Cost Classifications: Financial Statements, Cost Behavior, Assigning Costs, Cost Decisions

## 2.2 Cost Type / Rates

- Funcional Group: Databse Analyst, Help Desk Analyst, Netwrok Support, Tester, Programmer/Analyst, ...

- Unit: Administrative Systems, Administrative Web Services, Database Services, Identity & Access Management, Information Technology Systems (ITS), ITS Help Desk, ITS PC Support, ITSM Client & Operational Services, ...

## 2.3 Cost Models

## 2.4 Cost Management & Agreed Collaboration Code

- What is Agile Planning?
  
  - Agile approach to projects (Sponsor/Product Owner, project manager, developers, designers, tester/QA)
  
  - Agile teams have three level of planning (Release Plans, Iteration Plans, Day Plans)
  
  - Estimating for Release Plans
  
  - Story Points vs. Ideal Days
  
  - Now, Prioritize the Features
  
  - Risk can be an important deciding  factor
  
  - Finally, Derive Duration Using Velocity
  
  - Iteration Planning
  
  - Estimating Hours of Effort
  
  - Why Agile Planning Works

# 3 - BID COSTING

## Knowledge required for action

Assiststhe relevant departmentswith the bid costing for the ICT project.

1. Knows the differencebetween fixedand variable costs and can give typical examples from ICT projects.

2. Knows the differencebetween direct costs and overhead costs and can explain their significancefor the calculation of full costs and the contribution margin.

3. Knows the break-even point and can explain its significancefor the calculation of price or sales volume.

### 3.1 Difference between fixed / variable costs

- Fixed costs vs. variable costs (vs. semi-variable costs)

- Price and contract models (price, deadlines, profit, relationship of trust)

- Approaches: Waterfall-Model, Agile

- Pricing Alternatives: Fixed, Effort-based, Capped effortbased, Multi-stage, Requirements-based, Agile

### 3.2 Direct- and overhead costs / Calculation of full costs

- Definition: Direct Costs

- Definiaon: Indirect Costs

- Full Costing (Absorption Costing)

- Components of Absorption Costing

- Contribuang Margin

- Assignment Work: See Page 129

### 3.3 Break-even point / Price & sale calculation

- Break Even Point

- Break Even: Units Sold (Total Cost, Total Revenue, Break Even Point)

# 4 - BUDGETING

## Knowledge required for action

Draws up a budgetfor the implementationof the ICT project, considering the budgeting process of an organization and the financing plan.

1. Knows the basic requirements of a budget(e.g.reference to the future, reference to the period, timing, nature of a target, comprehensibility) and can explain the effects on liquidity.

2. Knows the overarching budgeting process of an organization and can explain its influenceon budgetingin his/her own area of responsibility.

### 4.1 Requirements of Budet / Liquidity

- Budget - Cash Flow Budget

- Budget - Cash Flow Statement

- Budget - Working Capital

# 5- BUDGET TRACKING

## Knowledge required for action

During the realizationof the ICT project, checks the effective effort against the budgetand proposes appropriate measures to deal with deviations.

1. Knows the basic parameters of cost control (e.g.planned costs, actual costs, forecast residual costs).

2. Knows suitable methods and instrumentsfor analyzingand presentingcosts(e.g., target/actual comparison, cost trend analysis, earned value analysis, cost of delay).

3. Knows typical contractual agreements for progress control in agile ICT projectswith fixed cost frameworks and fixed deadlines (e.g., checkpoints, acceptance criteria, risk share model between customer and supplier, efficiency bonus, exits)

4. Knows the parameters of the Magic Triangle and the Devil's Square and can explainthe relevanceof these models for the development of measuresin case of deviations.
