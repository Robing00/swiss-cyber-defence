# 1 - RESOURCES

## Knowledge needed for action

1. Knows typical structural elements of phase-oriented ICT projects (e.g.,  project phases, subprojects, work packages, tasks, work steps) and of  agile ICT projects (e.g., backlogs, iterations / sprints, timeboxing).

2. Knows typical items of resource planning in ICT projects (e.g. personnel,  
   material, operating resources, external services)

3. Knows suitable methods for determining or estimating effort (e.g.,  
   analogy method, expert panel, 3-point estimation, PERT method).

4. Knows relevant factors influencing the planning of personnel expenses  
   (e.g. availability, qualification, idle time and downtime).

## 1.1 Project Structure

- Work Breakdown Structure

- When and how to divide an ICT project

- Agile Projects (Backlogs, DoD, Epics, Stories, Features, User Storeis, Task)

## 1.2 Resources Planning

- Personnel

- Skill levels

- Project Ressources: 
  
  - People: Development, Testing, Analysis
  
  - Equipment: Technical, Admin, Logistics
  
  - Material

## 1.3 Estimation

- Cost Planning
  
  - TCO
  
  - Benefits

- Estimation of Effort
  
  - Need for estimates / Basic principles
  
  - Analogy method, Percentage method, Delphi method, Three-time method ("beta method"), Poker Planning (agile)

## 1.4 Planning Personnel Expenses

- Ressource Planning
  
  - Roles: Ressources, People, Material resources
  
  - Objectives: little shortage, little excess
  
  - Approach
    
    - 1, 2, x iteration of plaing (raw, detail planning)
    
    - Kiss - keep it simple, stupid
  
  - Variance: Productivity variants

# 2 - EFFORTS AND COST PLAN

## Knowledge needed for action

Determines effort based on resource planning and prepares a  structured cost plan.  

1. Knows the difference between investment costs, project execution costs and operating costs.  

2. Knows different cost rates in ICT projects and can name standard industry and market rates.  

3. Knows simple costing models for calculating expenses.  

4. Knows the approach to cost management in agile ICT projects (fixed cost framework, fixed deadlines and open scope) and the importance of a clearly agreed collaboration code (values, principles and practices).

## 2.1 Difference between investment costs

- Cost Categories: Investment costs, Execution costs, Operating costs

- Cost Classifications: Financial Statements, Cost Behavior, Assigning Costs, Cost Decisions

## 2.2 Cost Type / Rates

- Funcional Group: Databse Analyst, Help Desk Analyst, Netwrok Support, Tester, Programmer/Analyst, ...

- Unit: Administrative Systems, Administrative Web Services, Database Services, Identity & Access Management, Information Technology Systems (ITS), ITS Help Desk, ITS PC Support, ITSM Client & Operational Services, ...

## 2.3 Cost Models

## 2.4 Cost Management & Agreed Collaboration Code

- What is Agile Planning?
  
  - Agile approach to projects (Sponsor/Product Owner, project manager, developers, designers, tester/QA)
  
  - Agile teams have three level of planning (Release Plans, Iteration Plans, Day Plans)
  
  - Estimating for Release Plans
  
  - Story Points vs. Ideal Days
  
  - Now, Prioritize the Features
  
  - Risk can be an important deciding  factor
  
  - Finally, Derive Duration Using Velocity
  
  - Iteration Planning
  
  - Estimating Hours of Effort
  
  - Why Agile Planning Works
