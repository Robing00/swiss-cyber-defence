Web services testing involve conducting tests on web services and APIs. The main focus areas are request and response validation, verifying server's response and performance characteristics.

**A. Test for WSDL (Web Services Description Language)**

WSDL files can provide a lot of useful information such as exposed methods, parameters they expect, data types and structures, etc.

Tools: SoapUI, Burp Suite.

Procedure: Look for the WSDL file of the web service (usually found at `http://example.com/service?wsdl`) and review its contents.

**B. Test for XML Injections**

Tools: SoapUI, Burp Suite.

Procedure: Test various XML inputs in your SOAP requests. A common test is for XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

```xml
<!-- Try to include local or remote entities in SOAP requests. -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

**C. Test for SOAP Parameter Tampering**

SOAP Parameter Tampering involves changing existing SOAP parameters, adding new parameters, or changing the type of SOAP parameters to cause unexpected behaviour.

Tools: SoapUI, Burp Suite.

Procedure: Modify parameters in SOAP requests and observe how the application handles it.

**D. Test for REST Parameter Tampering**

Similar to SOAP Parameter Tampering, but for RESTful web services. This could involve modifying URL parameters, body content, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and HTTP headers.

Tools: Postman, Burp Suite.

Procedure: Modify requests and parameters and observe how the application handles it.

**E. Test for Replay Attacks**

Replay attacks involve capturing legitimate requests and then resending those requests, with the goal of the server treating the resent request as authentic.

Tools: Burp Suite.

Procedure: Capture a request using Burp Suite, and then resend the same request to see if the server accepts it.

**F. Test for JSON Web Token (JWT) Issues**

JSON Web Tokens are often used in APIs for authorization. They may be vulnerable to various attacks such as weak secret keys, none algorithm, and more.

Tools: JWT Tool, Burp Suite.

Procedure: Capture JWTs from API requests and test for various vulnerabilities using a tool like JWT Tool.
