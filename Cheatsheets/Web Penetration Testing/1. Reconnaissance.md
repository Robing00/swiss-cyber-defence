## Passive Reconnaissance

### WHOIS Lookup
The whois command in Linux can provide information about the domain. For example:

``` 
whois example.com
```

Or you can use online services like [whois.domaintools.com](https://whois.domaintools.com) or [who.is](https://who.is).


### DNS Lookup
The "dig" and "nslookup" commands in Linux can be used for DNS lookups. For example:

``` 
dig example.com nslookup example.com
```


### Subdomain Enumeration
Tools like Sublist3r, Amass, or Subfinder can be used. For example:
   
``` 
python sublist3r.py -d example.com  # Sublist3r amass enum -d example.com  # Amass subfinder -d example.com  # Subfinder
```


## Active Reconnaissance

### Network Scanning
Nmap is a popular tool for network scanning. Here are a few basic [[nmap]] commands:

``` 
# OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
# Scan specific port range nmap -A example.com  
nmap -sS example.com  # TCP SYN scan nmap -sU example.com  # UDP scan nmap -p 1-65535 example.com  
```

### Service Identification
Nmap can also be used to identify services running on open ports. For example:

``` 
nmap -sV example.com  # Service version detection
```


### Web Server Fingerprinting

Tools like BuiltWith or Wappalyzer can be used. These are typically browser extensions and don't use commands. However, WhatWeb can be used from the command line:

``` 
whatweb example.com
```
