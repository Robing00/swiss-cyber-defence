5. **Authorization Testing**

Authorization testing is the process of verifying that a user can only perform actions and see data that they are allowed to according to their permissions level.

**A. Test Directory/Path Traversal**

Tools: Browser, Burp Suite.

You need to check if a user can access resources that they are not supposed to access by modifying the path in the URL. 

```bash
# manually change the URL in the browser or use Burp Suite to modify the request
http://example.com/app/path_you_should_not_access
```

**B. Test Vertical Privilege Escalation**

Tools: Browser, Burp Suite.

This refers to users being able to gain higher privileges than what they should be allowed. For example, a regular user should not be able to perform administrative actions.

```bash
1. Login with a user that has lower privileges.
2. Try to perform an action or access resources that require higher privileges.
# This can be done by manipulating parameters, paths, or even HTTP methods.
```

**C. Test Horizontal Privilege Escalation**

Tools: Browser, Burp Suite.

This refers to users being able to access resources of another user on the same privilege level.

```bash
1. Login with a user.
2. Try to access resources of another user.
# This could be as simple as changing the user_id parameter in the URL or the body of the request.
```

**D. Test Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**

Tools: Browser, Burp Suite.

This is when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly and doesn't properly verify the user's authorization.

```bash
1. Identify points where the application uses user-supplied input to access objects.
2. Try to change these inputs to access objects you should not have access to.
```

**E. Test for Missing Function Level Access Control**

Tools: Browser, Burp Suite.

Sometimes developers hide features from the user interface but forget to protect the actual function. As a result, an attacker could access and use these hidden functions.

```bash
1. Login with a user that has lower privileges.
2. Intercept the requests and responses using Burp Suite.
3. Try to access the functionality that should be available only to higher privilege levels.
```

As always, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform these tests. Unauthorized testing could lead to severe penalties.
