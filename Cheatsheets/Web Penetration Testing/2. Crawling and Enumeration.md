## Directory Brute-forcing

Tools like DirBuster, Dirsearch, or [[Gobuster]] can help in finding hidden directories or files that might not be linked from the main pages of the website. Here are the commands for these tools:

```
dirbuster  # DirBuster (GUI based tool)
python3 dirsearch.py -u http://example.com -e php,html  # Dirsearch
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist  # Gobuster
```

## File Extensions Handling Check

Check if server leaks information when an unexpected file extension is requested. This can be done manually using the browser or automated scanners.

## Discover Hidden Files and Directories

Use the tools mentioned above and look for backup files, temporary files, or old versions of files.

## Understand Application Entry Points

Manually navigate the web application to understand the different entry points, functionalities, and the flow of the application.

## Identify Data Entry Points

Look for all places where user can input data, like forms, URL parameters, etc. This can be done manually, or with the help of automated tools like Burp Suite's spider or OWASP ZAP's spider.

## User Roles and Application Functionality

Create multiple accounts with different user roles, and observe the differences in application behavior and access control.
