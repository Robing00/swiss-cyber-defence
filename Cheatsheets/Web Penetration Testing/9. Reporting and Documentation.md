Once the testing phase is over, it's essential to document and report the findings in a clear and actionable manner.

**A. Documenting Vulnerabilities**

Each vulnerability found should be documented with details about:

1. Name/Type of vulnerability
2. Severity level
3. Vulnerable URL/Endpoint/Service
4. Steps to reproduce
5. Screenshots (if applicable)
6. Remediation advice

You can use tools like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or specialized software like Dradis or Serpico to organize your findings.

**B. Creating PoC (Proof of Concept)**

Proof of Concept involves demonstrating the exploit to prove its existence and show the potential impact on the system. It usually includes step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability. 

**C. Suggesting Remediation Steps**

It's always a good practice to suggest possible remediation steps for the vulnerabilities found. The recommendations should be as specific as possible, detailing the exact measures needed to mitigate the risks.

**D. Rating and Prioritizing Issues**

Vulnerabilities should be prioritized based on their severity. Common severity ratings include Critical, High, Medium, and Low. The CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) can be used as a guideline for scoring vulnerabilities.

**E. Documenting Testing Process**

In addition to documenting the findings, you should also document the testing process itself. This includes the tools used, methodologies followed, dates of testing, etc.

**F. Creating Final Report**

A final report should be compiled that includes an executive summary, a detailed account of the findings, and the suggested remediation steps. It's crucial to ensure that this report is easily understandable, not just for technical staff but also for non-technical stakeholders.

**G. Review and Feedback**

After the report is presented, there should be a discussion and review process to go over the findings and discuss the next steps. This is also an opportunity for the penetration tester to receive feedback on the testing process and results.

Remember, the goal of the report is to provide clear, actionable insights that will help improve the security posture of the system or application that was tested.
