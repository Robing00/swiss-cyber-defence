4. **Session Management Testing**

**A. Test for Session Cookies Attributes**

   Tools: Browser Developer Tools, Burp Suite.

   Using browser developer tools, navigate to the Application or Storage tab and look at the cookies being set by the website. Ensure that Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite attributes are set appropriately.

**B. Test for Session ID Life Cycle**

   Tools: Burp Suite.

   Intercept requests using Burp Suite and look at the changes in session IDs before and after login/logout. The session ID should change after login to prevent session fixation and it should be invalidated after logout to prevent unauthorized access.

```bash
1. Open Burp Suite and turn on the intercept under the Proxy -> Intercept tab.
2. Log into the web application while intercept is on.
3. Observe the cookies in the HTTP headers to see if session IDs are changing.
```

**C. Test for Session Fixation**

   Tools: Burp Suite.

   To test for session fixation, you need to check whether the session ID before login is still valid after login. If it is, that's a potential session fixation vulnerability.

```bash
1. Clear all cookies of the site from the browser.
2. Visit the site (without login) and note the session ID provided by the application.
3. Log into the web application and see if the application provides a new session ID.
4. Turn off intercept in Burp Suite, logout and use the noted session ID before login as a cookie and check if the session is still valid.
```

**D. Test for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

   Tools: Burp Suite.

   With CSRF, you need to check if there is CSRF token and how it's being handled. If the same CSRF token is used for the session lifetime or if the CSRF token isn't tied to the session, those could be potential vulnerabilities.

**E. Test for Logout Functionality**

   Tools: Browser, Burp Suite.

   To test logout functionality, logout from the application and then use the browser's back button to see if you can still access the application. Also, capture the logout request using Burp Suite and send the request again to see if the session was actually invalidated.

**F. Test for Session Timeout**

   Tools: Browser.

   To test session timeout, login to the application and do not interact with the site for some time. Try to interact after this period of inactivity and check whether the session is still valid.

**G. Test for Session Hijacking**

   Tools: Burp Suite.

   To test for session hijacking, use Burp Suite to intercept requests and replace your session ID with another user's session ID. You can only do this if you have another user's session ID which could be obtained by methods like XSS or sniffing insecure connections.

Always remember to get appropriate permissions before performing any of these tests. Unauthorized testing could lead to legal issues.
