1. **Information Gathering**
   - Begin with open-source intelligence (OSINT). Gather information about the application from publicly available resources. Look at the app store details, developer's website, and user reviews.

2. **Understanding the Mobile App Features**
   - Interact more deeply with the application. Map out its functionality and features. Identify all entry points for user input and any interaction with servers. Note any functionality that involves sensitive data.

3. **Server-Side Infrastructure Analysis**
   - If the mobile app communicates with a server, gather information about that server. Tools like nmap can be used to scan the server's IP address for open ports and running services. Always remember to respect the scope of your testing and not infringe on systems not included in the scope.

4. **Network Traffic Analysis**
   - Analyze the application's network traffic to understand its structure and how it communicates with its backend servers. You can do this by setting up a proxy with tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP.

    For example, for Burp Suite:
    - Configure your device or emulator to use Burp Suite as its proxy.
    - Open Burp Suite on your machine and navigate to the 'Proxy' tab, and then the 'Intercept' subtab.
    - Click on the 'Intercept is on' button and start using the app on your device or emulator.
    - As you interact with the app, the HTTP/S requests it makes will appear in Burp Suite. This can give you valuable information about the app's network interactions.

5. **Data Storage Analysis**
   - Inspect how and where the application stores data. For Android, explore the device file system or use the Android Debug Bridge (adb) to access app-specific files. On iOS, use tools like iFunBox or the built-in Files app for jailbroken devices.

6. **Identifying Associated Hosts and Services**
   - As part of your network traffic analysis, identify any third-party services or hosts the app interacts with. This might include ad networks, analytics providers, or external databases.
