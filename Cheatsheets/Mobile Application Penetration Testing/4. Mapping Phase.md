1. **Application Entry Points**

- Identify all the ways a user (or an attacker) can interact with the application. This could be through user input fields, file uploads, or interfaces with other applications or services. On Android, you might use tools like "drozer" to help map out the attack surface.

2. **User Roles and Privileges**

- Understand if the application has different user roles and what privileges each role has. This can help you identify areas where privilege escalation might be possible.

3. **Identifying the Attack Surface**

- Use the information gathered so far to outline the application's attack surface. This will include all entry points you've identified, the server-side infrastructure, and any associated third-party services.

For example, using jadx for static analysis:

- Run the command `jadx -d output_folder target_app.apk` to decompile an Android application.
- Explore the resulting files in the output folder. Look for interesting classes or methods related to your entry points.
- Pay special attention to areas of the app that handle user input or sensitive data.

4. **Data Flow Mapping**

- Create a map or diagram showing how data flows through the application. Note how it's input, how it's processed, where it's stored, and how it's output. This can help you spot potential areas where data could be intercepted or manipulated.

5. **Network Mapping**

- If the app communicates with servers or services, map out these interactions. Note any patterns in the requests or responses, or any points where data is sent unencrypted.

6. **Decompiling the Mobile App**

- Use tools like JADX for Android apps or Hopper for iOS apps to decompile the application and get a better understanding of its inner workings. This can help you identify potentially vulnerable code.

> Remember, the goal of this phase is to understand the application's layout, how its components interact, and where potential vulnerabilities may lie. This map will guide your testing in the next phases.
