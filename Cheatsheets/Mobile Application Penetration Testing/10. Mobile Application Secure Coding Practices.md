Absolutely, here's a hands-on approach for the "Mobile Application Secure Coding Practices":

1. **Secure Data Storage**

- Ensure data is stored securely on the device. Use platform-provided secure storage APIs like Android's Keystore system or iOS's Keychain service.

2. **Secure Network Communication**

- Implement secure communication channels. All data transmitted over a network should be encrypted using strong, up-to-date protocols like TLS 1.3.

3. **Input Validation**

- Always validate and sanitize user inputs, both on the client and the server side. Never trust data coming from the user, as it can be a potential source of attacks.

4. **Leak-Sensitive Information**

- Ensure that sensitive information is not leaked in the logs, error messages, or over insecure network connections.

5. **Implement Proper Session Management**

- Use secure session management techniques. Sessions should timeout and the application should not be vulnerable to session hijacking or replay attacks.

6. **Use Platform Security Features**

- Take advantage of the security features provided by the platform. This includes things like Android's permissions model or iOS's App Sandbox.

7. **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets**

- Never hardcode secrets like API keys or encryption keys into the application's code. These can be easily extracted by attackers.

8. **Principle of Least Privilege**

- Follow the principle of least privilege, which states that a process should only have the minimum privileges necessary to perform its function. This can minimize the potential damage from a security breach.

9. **Keep Libraries and Frameworks Updated**

- Outdated libraries and frameworks can introduce known vulnerabilities into your app. Regularly update all components of your application to the latest secure versions.

10. **OWASP Mobile Security Project**

- The OWASP Mobile Security Project provides a checklist of security controls that all mobile applications should implement. Regularly review and update your security practices based on the latest guidelines.

> This phase is more of a preventative measure, which involves the application developers more than the testers. However, as a penetration tester, having a good understanding of these practices will help you spot vulnerabilities and make suitable recommendations.
