Sure, here's a hands-on approach for the "Discovery Phase":

1. **Static Analysis**

- Examine the application's code to identify potential vulnerabilities. Use jadx for Android apps or Hopper for iOS apps to decompile the app and inspect the code. Look for insecure code practices, hard-coded secrets, or potential backdoors.

2. **Dynamic Analysis**

- Analyze the application's behavior during runtime. Tools like Frida or Xposed Framework for Android, and Cycript or Frida for iOS, can be used to modify the app's behavior at runtime and identify potential security issues.

For example, using Frida to hook a function:

- Run the command `frida -U -l myscript.js -f com.example.app` where "myscript.js" is your Frida script and "com.example.app" is the target application.
- In "myscript.js", you could use something like the following to hook a function:

    ```javascript
    Java.perform(function () {
      var TargetClass = Java.use('com.example.app.TargetClass');
      TargetClass.vulnerableFunction.implementation = function (arg) {
        console.log('Called vulnerableFunction with arg: ' + arg);
        return this.vulnerableFunction(arg);
      };
    });
    ```

- This script will print a message every time `vulnerableFunction` is called.

3. **Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities**

- Using the information gathered from static and dynamic analysis, identify potential vulnerabilities in the app. These might include weak encryption, insecure storage, or unprotected communication with servers.

4. **Traffic Interception**

- Interact with the app while intercepting its network traffic using a proxy like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP. This can help you identify how the app handles data in transit and whether it's adequately secured.

5. **Local Storage Analysis**

- Inspect the device file system for any data stored by the app. On Android, you can use Android Debug Bridge (adb) to explore the file system. On iOS, tools like iExplorer can be used. Look for sensitive data that is stored insecurely.
