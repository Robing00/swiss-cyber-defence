## Agenda

* Preparing and Organizations for Incident Response
* Identifying Organizational Assets and Risk
* Protecting an Organization from an Incident
* Detecting the Incident
* Responding to an Incident
* Recovering from an Incident

## Preparing and Organizations for Incident Response

### Why do we need an Incident Response Plan
* Your job... And basically everyone's job, depends on it.
* All companies have cybersec risk
* Regulations and laws require it
* It’s good for business
* To reduce impact and costs
* To set aside budget
* To understand and see your capabilities
* ... Can you think of more reasons?

### Some regulations
* PCI DSS
* HIPAA
* GDPR
* SOX

### Legal considerations
* Disconnect vs stay online
* Law enforcement
* Chain of custody
* Retention of records
* Privacy considerations

### Q&A from and for the CEO
* Ok... I know that I need an IR plan... What’s next?
* If an incident happens, what do we have to disclose? How do we handle that?
* How much will it cost?
* What did the attackers take? How did they got in?
* How long until we have full operations again?
* How can we prevent future incidents?
* How can we better prepared for future incidents?
* Who’s was/is the attacker? What’s the MOM?
    * Medium
    * Opportunity
    * Motive

### Questions you should focus on
* How do we manage the IR?
* What people and skills are needed?
* What technology is needed?
* How and what are we learning from previous incidents?

### How to define an incident
There is not easy/right answer for that. Each company can define an incident depending on their needs.

* Event
* Alert
* Small issue
* Big problem
* Confirmed breach

### Organization’s IR capabilities
1. Low maturity... No real capability
2. Moderate maturity... Some tools and skills
3. Mature

### Key components for IR plan
* Mission
* Goals
* Metrics
* Roadmap
* Organizational structure and responsibilities


### Other key components for IR plan
* Terminology
* Declaring an incident
* Roles
* Triage
* Communications
* Decisions to disconnect
* Recovery
* Lessons learned
* When to go back to main building

### Writing the plan
* W.O.R.N.
* Update
* Simple
* Store


#### NIST framework
* Preparation
* Detection and analysis
* Containment eradication and recovery
* Post incident activity

#### IR Team access
* Privileged accounts
* Policy
* Need to know and least privilege
* Monitoring

... quis custodiet ipsos custodes

#### IR Stakeholders
* Auditors
* HR
* IT
* Chief executives
* Public affairs
* Legal
* Customers

#### CEO’s support
Written policy is needed to give the security team the authority to implement controls and the visibility to get information needed.

#### CSIRT team
* From 1 to multiple
* Remote work or on-site
* 24x7 or 8x5
* Outsourcing
* Reverse engineering
* Threat intelligence
* Forensics
* Threat hunting
* Programmers

#### RACI for IR

## Identifying Organizational Assets and Risk (Before the Incident)

### Basic requirements

* Updated network diagrams
* Ports, protocols and configuration documentation
* Baselines and gold images
* Policies and procedures


### Documentation and configurationsecurity & baseline
* Network devices configuration and policies
* Backups
* Baseline images
* Hashes and digital signatures
* Asset inventory

### Risk based approach
* Threat – Available exploits?
* Probability – known and zero day
* Impact
* Exposure
* Current countermeasures

### Vulnerability scan and pentesting
* What’s the difference?
* How do they complement
* How can they help to create, implement and maintain an IR plan?
* How can they help reduce risk?

### Frameworks


#### CIS TOP 18 Controls
* Not 20 controls
* Combined by activities and not by devices
* Migrated from 171 sub-controls to 153 safeguards
* Safeguard are still prioritized by IG (Implementation Groups)

![](16517173613505.png)

#### NIST CSF

* Identify – What processes and assets must be protected
* Protect – What countermeasures are available
* Detect – What technologies and techniques can identify incidents
* Respond – What controls can mitigate the impact

### IT and Cyber Security

* Without the IT department, there’s no need for security
* Reporting structure can cause problems
* Use RACI if necessary
* IT lack of knowledge or is under-resourced
* IT should maintain accurate documentation
* IT and cyber security must understand risk

### SLA and OLA
* Clearly defined responsibilities, penalties and rewards between internal and external providers
* Clearly defined KPI to measure SLA and OLA
* Create balanced scorecards for compliance
* Take into consideration all the impacts (e.g. business image)
* Take into consideration laws and regulations

### SLA and OLA – KPIs
* Pentesting and vulnerability scanning results
* RTO, RPO and MTBF
* Patching %
* Incidents per month
* ... Can you think of other important KPIs?

### Detection sources
* Cloud
* User activity and complaints
* Endpoint / Servers and entity activity
* Applications and sensors
* Mobile devices
* Network Traffic

#### SIEM
* Correlation and aggregation from several sources
* Be careful about about is time zones
* Configure the dashboard to match your KPI and KRI
* Define RACI for SIEM and alerts

##### SIEM – Problems
* Receiving the correct information?
* Getting information from the correct sources?
* Configuring the correct use cases?
* Running the correct playbooks?
* Does it have the user and entity context?

#### XDR
* Extended detection and response (XDR) is cross-layered detection and response.
* XDR collects and automatically correlates data across multiple security layers – email, endpoint, server, cloud workloads, and network – so threats are detected faster and security analysts improve investigation and response times.
* XDR represents the evolution of detection and response(EDR) beyond the current point-solution, single-vector approach.

##### XDR – Augmenting SIEM
* Organizations use SIEMs to collect logs and alerts from multiple solutions. While SIEMs allow companies to bring together a lot of information from multiple places for centralized visibility, they result in an overwhelming number of individual alerts.
* XDR collects deep activity data and feeds that information into a data lake for cross-layer sweeping, hunting, and investigation. Applying AI and expert analytics to the rich data set enables fewer, context-rich alerts, which can be sent to a company’s SIEM solution.

##### XDR – Sources and analytics
* Descriptive
* Diagnostic
* Predictive
* Prescriptive

##### XDR – Detection approaches
* Rules-based anomaly detection
* Historical analysis
* Machine learning and AI
* Mixed

#### UEBA
* UEBA stands for User and Entity Behavior Analytics and was previously known as user behavior analytics (UBA).
* UEBA uses large datasets to model typical and atypical behaviors of humans and machines within a network.
* By defining such baselines it can identify suspicious behavior, potential threats and attacks that traditional antivirus may not detect.

#### SOAR

* SOAR (security orchestration, automation and response) is a stack of compatible software programs that enables an organization to collect data about security threats and respond to security events without human assistance.
* What SOC teams are looking for:
    * Automate Repeated Response Workflow
    * Save Time for Higher Priority Triage Tasks
    * Easy Standardized Response to follow

##### SOAR – Benefits
* Consolidate process management, technology and expertise
* Centralize asset monitoring
* Enrich alerts with contextual intelligence
* Automate response and perform inline blocking



## Protecting an Organization from an Incident
