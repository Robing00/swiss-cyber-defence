# Projects IT Project Management

## Module 690

## Plan lead and oversee projects

## Competence

Structures and plans a project based on the specified project mission, manages and monitors the project during implementation, and periodically informs decision makers of project progress.

### What makes ICT projects unique?

- While ICT projects are often compared to building or construction projects, there are some marked departures between these and ICT projects.

- Â I will outline a few of those differences on the following pages as introduction

- Cost out projects: CHF per unit of building size m/2

- Construction -> not involve unproved materials | ICT project new soft- and hardware (project risk)

- Abscence of enforceable controls on ICT projects. 

- Maturity Models: CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)

- Process models: Identify, improve, processes, products, continuous process improvement

- Frequency of Updates (Cost of software development only fraction of life cycle costs)

- Construction -> Most expensive part is to build up

## Goals for Actions

- Analysis and Approach

- Divide et Impera

- Planning

- Communication

- Subprojects

- Chnage Management

- Risks and Countermeasures

- Controlling

- Reporting

## Examples of Projects

- Technical projects

- Artistic projects

- Organizational projects (Implementation of an enterprise software)

- Scientific projects (Genome Project, ISS)

## Definition

- Project (related to DIN 69901) 
  
  - Start and End, is temporary, one-time
  
  - Project delivered in a scope (time, cost, resources, organization, quality, ..)

- Project Management
  
  - Organizing and managing ressources
  
  - Art of solving a given problem in a certain time / ressources

- Example of Project Definition
  
  - What can be defined as a project?
    
    - Exam, academic studies
    
    - Preparation and execution of a voter mandate to govern a country
    
    - Software implementation project
    
    - Football World Championship
  
  - What is usally not a project?
    
    - Reading book for the academic studies (no start / finish date)
    
    - initiating a political debate (not target, no process model)
    
    - Answering eMail
  
  - What is a successful project
    
    - Possible criteria
      
      - In the mood good?
      
      - Is
  
  - Study Project Success
    
    - Can you draw any conclutions?
    
    - Would you have any example of failed projects?

Example of Failures

- Ariane 5

- Mars Climate Orbiter

- Toll Collect

Why Project Management?

- Better control of financial, pysical, and human resources

- Improved customer relations

- Shorter development imes

- Lower cots

- Higher quality and incread reliability

- Higher profit margins

- Improved productivity

Law of Project Managment

- Progess quickly until 90%. 10% take forever

- Things to well, something go wrong

Why are there projects?

- extraordinary problems (no day-to-day routine)

Ranking of most important Difficulties

- According to Pazak / Rattay

### Operations vs Projects

Origins of Projects
